# Introduction
The way music is consumed and distributed has changed dramatically over the past few decades. The rise of digital streaming platforms such as Spotify has transformed music into an on-demand service, replacing the need to purchase physical products such as CDs or vinyl. [^music_industry_shift] 

Today, streaming generates over 67% of global music revenues [^global_music_report], confirming its dominance in the industry. With 675 million monthly active users [^spotify_report] and a market share of over 30% [^streaming_stats], Spotify is the clear leader in the music streaming market. While this shift has made music more accessible than ever, it also poses questions about its environmental impact, since streaming requires a service provider, constant network data transmission, and device power.

In recent years, web-based streaming has become more and more popular as it eliminates the need for users to install additional applications on their devices. While web applications are often favoured for their accessibility and convenience, desktop applications often offer more features to the user. In this article, we compare the energy consumption of Spotify's web and desktop applications. By analysing these differences, we aim to provide valuable insights to help users make better decisions about their streaming habits.

# Methodology
This chapter describes the methodology used to compare the energy consumption of Spotify's web and desktop applications. It covers the design of the experiment and how the experiment itself was conducted, including the automation and setup of the experiment.

## Design of the experiment
The first thing to do before conducting the experiment is to design it. This involves identifying a specific use case for the application, in our case Spotify's web and desktop application. It is also important to design the experiment in such a way that it mimics actual user behaviour and is realistic.

First, we designed and conducted an experiment with both applications (desktop and web) open at the same time. We switched between the windows and randomly played exactly one song in each test run. However, the disadvantages of this type of experiment were that the other window that was open in the background affected the accuracy of the measurement. Also, playing a random song for each run has an effect on energy consumption. Thus, the data were not really normally distributed. The result of this first experiment can be found in the chapter [Results initial setup without closing and opening (web)app](#results-initial-setup-without-closing-and-opening-webapp).

The aim in designing the revised experiment was to minimise any bias from other applications and to focus only on the application being run. In addition, we still wanted to play more than one song to mimic realistic user behaviour, but we also wanted the data to be normally distributed across the experiment. So we had to design the individual runs to be similar, but with a certain degree of randomness built in.

For the final experiment, we decided to have 30 runs per application. The runs themselves are randomly mixed. For a single run, we first open the application (i.e. web or desktop). We then wait a few seconds for the application to fully load so that the opening has no effect on the energy measurement. We did not want to include the start of the application in this measurement as we only wanted to focus on the use case of playing music. Next, the energy measurement is started and four songs are played in random order. Each song is played for 20 seconds. Including the delays for starting and searching for the songs, a run takes about 2 minutes. After the run, the application is closed and we pause for 1 minute. So the whole experiment takes about 3 hours.


## Experiment setup
In general, testing the power consumption of applications is difficult because multiple runs can give different results. For this reason, we have chosen to perform 30 runs per application. However, there are several other factors that can affect the measurement. To reduce any bias as much as possible, we did the following before starting the experiment:

- Let the device run for at least one hour to warm it up.
- Charge the device's battery to 100% and plug it in.
- Close all applications (except the console running the automated test script).
- Disable all unnecessary background services (e.g. cloud sync, software updater, ...).
- Turn off all notifications.
- Ensure that no additional hardware is connected to the device (e.g. remove USB mouse).
- Establish a stable internet connection - preferably a wired connection.
- Turn off automatic brightness.
- Disable any power saving modes on the device.
- Log in to the Spotify desktop and web application beforehand and ensure that the volume in both applications is set to 100%. Close applications before starting the experiment.
- Ensure that the room temperature remains approximately the same throughout the experiment.


## Experiment execution
Since it would be impossible to manually run 60 experiments without introducing bias from user input, we automated the testing process using a _Python_ script. The Spotify apps are mostly controlled via keyboard shortcuts using the _pyautogui_ library. The energy measurements are done using [EnergiBridge](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge), which is a cross-platform energy measurement utility.[^energi_bridge]

The script starts with an initialisation and warm-up phase before actually running the experiments. During this phase, the brightness of the display and the volume of the speakers are automatically adjusted. To wam up, a simple Fibonacci sequence is computed for three minutes. Afterwards, the experiment is run as described in the [Design of the experiment](#design-of-the-experiment) chapter.

## Replication

# Results 

## Results initial setup without closing and opening (web)app
As discussed in the methodology, our initial approach was to keep the app and the web browser open during all experiments. The results, as can be seen in Figure 1 show a plot without a normal distribution. We assume that the results with a lower energy consumption might have benefitted from internal cashing. This lead us to change our setup to open and close the (web)app for every run.

## Results improved setup
### Violin and Box Plots and Outliers Removal
We have plotted the data[^github] collected from the experiment into two violin and box plots, as can be seen in Figure 2. It is clear from the plots that both the result for the web and native version contain outliers. We used Shapiro-Wilk test to check if our results are normal, the results from this test can be seen in Table 1. The p-value for the web version (2.1 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and for the native version (5.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) reported by the Shapiro-Wilk are smaller than 0.05 and thus the data is not normally distributed. We therefore used z-score outlier removal to remove outliers, we had to apply this twice before the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test was larger than 0.05, as can be seen in Table 2. The violin and box plots for the data without outliers can be seen in Figure 3. We removed three data points, two from the web version (129.5J and 788.4J) and one from the native version (814.3J).

| Shapiro-Wilk            	| W      	| p-value     	|
|-------------------------	|--------	|-------------	|
| With outliers web       	| 0.5549 	| 2.1 * 10<sup>-8</sup> 	|
| With outliers native    	| 0.8456 	| 5.0 * 10<sup>-4</sup> 	|
| Without outliers web    	| 0.9573 	| 0.3002      	|
| Without outliers native 	| 0.9882 	| 0.9809      	|

### Welch's t_test and Significance
To determine the significance of our results we used Welch’s t-test, which reported a t-statistic of -9.3 and a p-value of 3.21 × 10<sup>-12</sup>. Since p < 0.05 we conclude that there is a statistically significant difference. From the t-statistic we conclude that the native version consumes significantly more energy.

### Effect Size
To get an insight into the effect size of our experiments we computed multiple values, including the average difference, percent change and cohan's d, these can be seen in Table 2.

|                	| Web   	| Native 	| Difference 	|
|----------------	|-------	|--------	|------------	|
| Minimum value  	| 572.4 	| 653.2  	| 80.8       	|
| Maximum value  	| 711.4 	| 741.2  	| 29.8       	|
| Average        	| 625.3 	| 692.7  	| 67.4       	|
| Percent change 	|       	|        	| 10.78%     	|
| Cohan's d      	|       	|        	| 2.4        	|

*Table 2: Effect size analysis.*

# Discussion
he first interesting data point that can be observed is the higher energy consumption in the native desktop version of around 10.78%. There could be several reasons for this firstly, the Spotify native desktop application has many more features when compared to the web app. Some of these features are a higher audio quality, an offline mode which might require additional processing and an equalizer which leads to additional processing overhead[^spotify_WebApp_vs_Native]. In addition, the desktop version of Spotify uses a cache which further increases the energy consumption. The difference in peak power consumption is 29.8 J. This suggests that under peak workloads the power consumption is similar despite the desktop version having more features. This also ties in with the higher baseline or minimum power consumption of the native desktop by 80.8 J. This implies that these additional features require background processes to run even when the song is not played which consume additional energy. The Android version of the app which was tested against the web version on the same mobile platform performed with better energy efficiency.  
<!-- TODO: Mention that the desktop version has more features than the web verions, that might consume more energy. But the desktop version has caching, which does not improve it -->

<!-- TODO: also mention the paper https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/MOBILESoft_2023.pdf and mention that on Android, it is opposite -->

# Limations and Issues
The experiment methodology has a few issues such not being able to cover all the use cases. The experiment only collects data for a maximum amount of 2 minutes per data point but this can be increased to around 5-10 minutes. Not all of the feautres were tested within this short time frame only the playing of a song. The native and the webapp version also have different audio qualities, video playback, UI which might affect measurements. Another issue with testing the webapp version was it was done only on one browser that is chrome. In addition to this only one operating system was tested. It could be the case that 
<!-- TODO: mention that the experiment does not cover all use cases-->
<!-- TODO: mention that the app have different settings (e.g. audio quality, video playback, caching ...) that also influences the energy consumption and that the desktop app has in general more setting-->

# Conclusion

# Future Work
<!-- TODO: what could maybe be added here: compare more use cases, compare different browsers, compare different settings for audio quality, disable video, ...-->
